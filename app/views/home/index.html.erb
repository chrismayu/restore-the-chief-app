              The Passion
            </h2>
  		<p>With each passing day, the advancements in technology never cease to amaze me. We have come so far as a society,  but while we are still discovering the secrets of the universe, pieces of our heritage lay rotting and dying in barns across our countries.</p><p> <strong>I have been given the rare and unique opportunity to preserve a piece of aviation history.  </strong> This is a gift that I want to share with you, The Kickstarter Community.  With your partnership, we can together save, restore, and preserve an aircraft relic for the educational advancement and enjoyment for future generations.  My passion is to preserve this piece of history and not let it be left as just a picture in a history book.   
			</p><p>The 11BC-1343 was built in 1946,  unlike many of it's relatives - it has survived the test of time, but currently lays in pieces.  1343 has seen many good times and could tell many stories. With your help, 1343 could see many more.  I have the skills, ability and time to complete this rescue mission, but 1343 and I  need your support. I can assure you that every penny from this Kickstarter will be going to towards the restoration of the aircraft.  Your support will be used for such things as parts, certifications and tools as well as any unforeseen issues that may arise along the way.
				</p><p>
			     As time goes on, these gems will be found less and less and be found in worst condition.

			Our children may never know what these beauties looked like, or sounded like. They may never know the feeling you get while flying in these vintage aircraft, which were made during a simpler time and know what is it like to be a part of the sky in a pipe box cover in fabric. </p><p>  Please join me in this rescue mission - We need to  <strong>Restore the Chief</strong>

            1343, built in 1946
          </h3>
		  <p>built in 1946 in Vandalia, Ohio by the Aeronca Aircraft Corporation. 1343 was built as a 11AC model but in 1981 it was converted to a 11BC model and used as a float plane. 1343 saw many lakes and streams. As is common with the materials used in those days, the fabric has deteriorated and the frame must be rebuilt. </p>

            The Challenge
          </h2>
		<p>


			The plane has been disassembled and is in pieces. This presents the biggest challenge.
			The wing is waiting for four new spars as the current ones are beyond repair. Also the round ends on the wings are also beyond repair. New wing bows will be needed . The Engine was "Pickled" properly but it has not ran for 12 years. It will need to be serviced and check for it's condition. Due to the common use of the engine - it is getting harder to find parts for it
 </p><p>
			Thankfully the person that started the restoration years ago has done a great job of labeling everything.
