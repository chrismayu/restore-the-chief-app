              How This Book is Different:
            </h2>
            <h3>
              No prior knowledge required
            </h3>
            <p>
              This is the first book for beginners that makes no assumptions about your previous knowledge. If you've worked with HTML and CSS, you have everything you need to succeed with this book.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other books assume you have previous knowledge of web application development principles. This book starts with the basics so no one gets lost.
            </p>
            <h3>
              A real-world application you can use
            </h3>
            <p>
              Learn by doing. You'll build a real-world Rails application that can be used by a typical small business. The website will include a home page, "about" page, contact form, and option to sign up for a mailing list.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can deploy the application and actually use it for someone's business.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Learn workplace skills
            </h3>
            <p>
              This book is unique in covering the basics while introducing the techniques of professional Rails development. Though written for beginners, the book shows how to use the tools that Rails developers actually use in the workplace. Work practices that are often said to be "too complicated for beginners" are introduced and demystified so you're prepared for a real job as a developer.
